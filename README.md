# EIACD 21-22
This repository holds the two group projects developed for the subject "elements of artificial intelligence and data science" with @Nia3324 during our first university year.

## Ataxx
Ataxx is a two player board game where the objective is to conquer the coard by transforming the other player's pieces into your own. It is possible to play against another human, an AI agent or even watch a game between 2 Computer Agents. For this project we explored a random agent, a greedy agent and a minimmaz agent.

## Data Science analysis
For this project we analysed the given data in several different ways, using Pandas, Seaborn and Scikit Learn.
